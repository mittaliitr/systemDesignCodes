What is a Token Bucket Rate Limiter?
Think of a token bucket as a container that holds a certain number of tokens (like coupons or tickets). You need a token to perform an action. Over time, new tokens are added to the bucket at a regular rate. If the bucket has enough tokens, you can perform the action; if not, you have to wait until more tokens are available.
